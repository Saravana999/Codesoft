Advertising Sales Prediction
This repository contains Python code for predicting sales based on advertising spending using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models. It utilizes the scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks and pandas for data manipulation.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is stored in a CSV file named advertising.csv. It contains information about advertising spending on different media channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and the corresponding sales figures. The dataset is loaded using pandas.

Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install them using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Usage
 
  1.Clone the repository:
     git clone https://github.com/Saravana999/advertising-sales-prediction.git
 
  2.Navigate to the project directory:
  
        cd advertising-sales-prediction

  3.Run the Python script:
        python advertising_sales_prediction.py


This will train both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models on the dataset and display the evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R-squared.

Results
The results of the predictions are visualized using scatter plots for both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models. The plots show the relationship between actual and predicted sales.
